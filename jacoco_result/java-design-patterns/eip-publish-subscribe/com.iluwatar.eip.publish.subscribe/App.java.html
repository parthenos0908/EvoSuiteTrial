/**
 * There are well-established patterns for implementing broadcasting. The Observer pattern describes
 * the need to decouple observers from their subject (that is, the originator of the event) so that
 * the subject can easily provide event notification to all interested observers no matter how many
 * observers there are (even none). The Publish-Subscribe pattern expands upon Observer by adding
 * the notion of an event channel for communicating event notifications.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A Publish-Subscribe Channel works like this: It has one input channel that splits into
 * multiple output channels, one for each subscriber. When an event is published into the channel,
 * the Publish-Subscribe Channel delivers a copy of the message to each of the output channels. Each
 * output end of the channel has only one subscriber, which is allowed to consume a message only
 * once. In this way, each subscriber gets the message only once, and consumed copies disappear from
 * their channels.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In this example we use Apache Camel to establish a Publish-Subscribe Channel from
 * &quot;direct-origin&quot; to &quot;mock:foo&quot;, &quot;mock:bar&quot; and &quot;stream:out&quot;.
