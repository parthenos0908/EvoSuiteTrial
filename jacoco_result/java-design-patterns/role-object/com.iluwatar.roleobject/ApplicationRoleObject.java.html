/**
 * The Role Object pattern suggests to model context-specific views of an object as separate role
 * objects which are dynamically attached to and removed from the core object. We call the resulting
 * composite object structure, consisting of the core and its role objects, a subject. A subject
 * often plays several roles and the same role is likely to be played by different subjects. As an
 * example consider two different customers playing the role of borrower and investor, respectively.
 * Both roles could as well be played by a single {@link Customer} object. The common superclass for
 * customer-specific roles is provided by {@link CustomerRole}, which also supports the {@link
 * Customer} interface.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The {@link CustomerRole} class is abstract and not meant to be instantiated.
 * Concrete subclasses of {@link CustomerRole}, for example {@link BorrowerRole} or {@link
 * InvestorRole}, define and implement the interface for specific roles. It is only these subclasses
 * which are instantiated at runtime. The {@link BorrowerRole}  class defines the context-specific
 * view of {@link Customer} objects as needed by the loan department. It defines additional
 * operations to manage the customer窶冱 credits and securities. Similarly, the {@link InvestorRole}
 * class adds operations specific to the investment department窶冱 view of customers. A client like
 * the loan application may either work with objects of the {@link CustomerRole} class, using the
 * interface class {@link Customer}, or with objects of concrete {@link CustomerRole} subclasses.
 * Suppose the loan application knows a particular {@link Customer} instance through its {@link
 * Customer} interface. The loan application may want to check whether the {@link Customer} object
 * plays the role of Borrower. To this end it calls {@link Customer#hasRole(Role)} with a suitable
 * role specification. For the purpose of our example, let窶冱 assume we can name roles with enum. If
 * the {@link Customer} object can play the role named 窶廝orrower,窶� the loan application will ask it
 * to return a reference to the corresponding object. The loan application may now use this
 * reference to call Borrower-specific operations.
