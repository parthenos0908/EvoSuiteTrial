/**
 * The Business Delegate pattern adds an abstraction layer between the presentation and business
 * tiers. By using the pattern we gain loose coupling between the tiers. The Business Delegate
 * encapsulates knowledge about how to locate, connect to, and interact with the business objects
 * that make up the application.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Some of the services the Business Delegate uses are instantiated directly, and some can be
 * retrieved through service lookups. The Business Delegate itself may contain business logic too
 * potentially tying together multiple service calls, exception handling, retrying etc.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In this example the client ({@link Client}) utilizes a business delegate (
 * {@link BusinessDelegate}) to execute a task. The Business Delegate then selects the appropriate
 * service and makes the service call.
