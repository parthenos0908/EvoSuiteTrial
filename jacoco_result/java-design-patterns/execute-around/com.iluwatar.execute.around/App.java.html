/**
 * The Execute Around idiom specifies some code to be executed before and after a method. Typically
 * the idiom is used when the API has methods to be executed in pairs, such as resource
 * allocation/deallocation or lock acquisition/release.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In this example, we have {@link SimpleFileWriter} class that opens and closes the file for
 * the user. The user specifies only what to do with the file by providing the {@link
 * FileWriterAction} implementation.
