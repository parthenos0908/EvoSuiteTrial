/**
 * This application demonstrates the &lt;b&gt;Dirty Flag&lt;/b&gt; pattern. The dirty flag behavioral pattern
 * allows you to avoid expensive operations that would just need to be done again anyway. This is a
 * simple pattern that really just explains how to add a bool value to your class that you can set
 * anytime a property changes. This will let your class know that any results it may have previously
 * calculated will need to be calculated again when they窶决e requested. Once the results are
 * re-calculated, then the bool value can be cleared.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;There are some points that need to be considered before diving into using this pattern:-
 * there are some things you窶冤l need to consider:- (1) Do you need it? This design pattern works
 * well when the results to be calculated are difficult or resource intensive to compute. You want
 * to save them. You also don窶冲 want to be calculating them several times in a row when only the
 * last one counts. (2) When do you set the dirty flag? Make sure that you set the dirty flag within
 * the class itself whenever an important property changes. This property should affect the result
 * of the calculated result and by changing the property, that makes the last result invalid. (3)
 * When do you clear the dirty flag? It might seem obvious that the dirty flag should be cleared
 * whenever the result is calculated with up-to-date information but there are other times when you
 * might want to clear the flag.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In this example, the {@link DataFetcher} holds the &lt;i&gt;dirty flag&lt;/i&gt;. It fetches and
 * re-fetches from &lt;i&gt;world.txt&lt;/i&gt; when needed. {@link World} mainly serves the data to the
 * front-end.
