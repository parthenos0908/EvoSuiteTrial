/**
 * Dependency Injection pattern deals with how objects handle their dependencies. The pattern
 * implements so called inversion of control principle. Inversion of control has two specific rules:
 * - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
 * - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In this example we show you three different wizards. The first one ({@link SimpleWizard}) is
 * a naive implementation violating the inversion of control principle. It depends directly on a
 * concrete implementation which cannot be changed.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The second and third wizards({@link AdvancedWizard} and {@link AdvancedSorceress}) are more
 * flexible. They do not depend on any concrete implementation but abstraction. They utilizes
 * Dependency Injection pattern allowing their {@link Tobacco} dependency to be injected through
 * constructor ({@link AdvancedWizard}) or setter ({@link AdvancedSorceress}). This way, handling
 * the dependency is no longer the wizard's responsibility. It is resolved outside the wizard
 * class.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The fourth example takes the pattern a step further. It uses Guice framework for Dependency
 * Injection. {@link TobaccoModule} binds a concrete implementation to abstraction. Injector is then
 * used to create {@link GuiceWizard} object with correct dependencies.
