/**
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The Strangler pattern is a software design pattern that incrementally migrate a legacy
 * system by gradually replacing specific pieces of functionality with new applications and
 * services. As features from the legacy system are replaced, the new system eventually
 * replaces all of the old system's features, strangling the old system and allowing you
 * to decommission it.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This pattern is not only about updating but also enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In this example, {@link OldArithmetic} indicates old system and its implementation depends
 * on its source ({@link OldSource}). Now we tend to update system with new techniques and
 * new features. In reality, the system may too complex, so usually need gradual migration.
 * {@link HalfArithmetic} indicates system in the process of migration, its implementation
 * depends on old one ({@link OldSource}) and under development one ({@link HalfSource}). The
 * {@link HalfSource} covers part of {@link OldSource} and add new functionality. You can release
 * this version system with new features, which also supports old version system functionalities.
 * After whole migration, the new system ({@link NewArithmetic}) only depends on new source
 * ({@link NewSource}).&lt;/p&gt;
