/**
 * Event Sourcing : Instead of storing just the current state of the data in a domain, use an
 * append-only store to record the full series of actions taken on that data. The store acts as the
 * system of record and can be used to materialize the domain objects. This can simplify tasks in
 * complex domains, by avoiding the need to synchronize the data model and the business domain,
 * while improving performance, scalability, and responsiveness. It can also provide consistency for
 * transactional data, and maintain full audit trails and history that can enable compensating
 * actions.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This App class is an example usage of Event Sourcing pattern. As an example, two bank account
 * is created, then some money deposit and transfer actions are taken so a new state of accounts is
 * created. At that point, state is cleared in order to represent a system shot down. After the shot
 * down, system state is recovered by re-creating the past events from event journal. Then state is
 * printed so a user can view the last state is same with the state before system shot down.
