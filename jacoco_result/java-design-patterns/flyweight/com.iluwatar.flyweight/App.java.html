package com.iluwatar.flyweight;

/**
 * Flyweight pattern is useful when the program needs a huge amount of objects. It provides means to
 * decrease resource usage by sharing object instances.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In this example {@link AlchemistShop} has great amount of potions on its shelves. To fill the
 * shelves {@link AlchemistShop} uses {@link PotionFactory} (which represents the Flyweight in this
 * example). Internally {@link PotionFactory} holds a map of the potions and lazily creates new ones
 * when requested.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To enable safe sharing, between clients and threads, Flyweight objects must be immutable.
 * Flyweight objects are by definition value objects.
