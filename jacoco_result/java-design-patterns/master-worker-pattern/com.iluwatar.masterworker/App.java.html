/**
 * &lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master-Worker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; pattern is used when the problem at hand can be solved by
 * dividing into multiple parts which need to go through the same computation and may need to be
 * aggregated to get final result. Parallel processing is performed using a system consisting of a
 * master and some number of workers, where a master divides the work among the workers, gets the
 * result back from them and assimilates all the results to give final result. The only
 * communication is between the master and the worker - none of the workers communicate among one
 * another and the user only communicates with the master to get required job done.&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;In our example, we have generic abstract classes {@link MasterWorker}, {@link Master} and
 * {@link Worker} which have to be extended by the classes which will perform the specific job at
 * hand (in this case finding transpose of matrix, done by {@link ArrayTransposeMasterWorker},
 * {@link ArrayTransposeMaster} and {@link ArrayTransposeWorker}). The Master class divides the work
 * into parts to be given to the workers, collects the results from the workers and aggregates it
 * when all workers have responded before returning the solution. The Worker class extends the
 * Thread class to enable parallel processing, and does the work once the data has been received
 * from the Master. The MasterWorker contains a reference to the Master class, gets the input from
 * the App and passes it on to the Master. These 3 classes define the system which computes the
 * result. We also have 2 abstract classes {@link Input} and {@link Result}, which contain the input
 * data and result data respectively. The Input class also has an abstract method divideData which
 * defines how the data is to be divided into segments. These classes are extended by {@link
 * ArrayInput} and {@link ArrayResult}.&lt;/p&gt;
