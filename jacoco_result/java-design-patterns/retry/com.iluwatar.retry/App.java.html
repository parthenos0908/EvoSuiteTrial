/**
 * The &lt;em&gt;Retry&lt;/em&gt; pattern enables applications to handle potentially recoverable failures from
 * the environment if the business requirements and nature of the failures allow it. By retrying
 * failed operations on external dependencies, the application may maintain stability and minimize
 * negative impact on the user experience.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In our example, we have the {@link BusinessOperation} interface as an abstraction over all
 * operations that our application performs involving remote systems. The calling code should remain
 * decoupled from implementations.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;{@link FindCustomer} is a business operation that looks up a customer's record and returns
 * its ID. Imagine its job is performed by looking up the customer in our local database and
 * returning its ID. We can pass {@link CustomerNotFoundException} as one of its {@link
 * FindCustomer#FindCustomer(java.lang.String, com.iluwatar.retry.BusinessException...) constructor
 * parameters} in order to simulate not finding the customer.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Imagine that, lately, this operation has experienced intermittent failures due to some weird
 * corruption and/or locking in the data. After retrying a few times the customer is found. The
 * database is still, however, expected to always be available.  While a definitive solution is
 * found to the problem, our engineers advise us to retry the operation a set number of times with a
 * set delay between retries, although not too many retries otherwise the end user will be left
 * waiting for a long time, while delays that are too short will not allow the database to recover
 * from the load.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To keep the calling code as decoupled as possible from this workaround, we have implemented
 * the retry mechanism as a {@link BusinessOperation} named {@link Retry}.
