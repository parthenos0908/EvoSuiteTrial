/**
 * &lt;p&gt;Type object pattern is the pattern we use when the OOP concept of creating a base class and
 * inheriting from it just doesn't work for the case in hand. This happens when we either don't know
 * what types we will need upfront, or want to be able to modify or add new types conveniently w/o
 * recompiling repeatedly. The pattern provides a solution by allowing flexible creation of required
 * objects by creating one class, which has a field which represents the 'type' of the object.&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;In this example, we have a mini candy-crush game in action. There are many different candies
 * in the game, which may change over time, as we may want to upgrade the game. To make the object
 * creation convenient, we have a class {@link Candy} which has a field name, parent, points and
 * Type. We have a json file {@link candy} which contains the details about the candies, and this is
 * parsed to get all the different candies in {@link JsonParser}. The {@link Cell} class is what the
 * game matrix is made of, which has the candies that are to be crushed, and contains information on
 * how crushing can be done, how the matrix is to be reconfigured and how points are to be gained.
 * The {@link CellPool} class is a pool which reuses the candy cells that have been crushed instead
 * of making new ones repeatedly. The {@link CandyGame} class has the rules for the continuation of
 * the game and the {@link App} class has the game itself.&lt;/p&gt;
