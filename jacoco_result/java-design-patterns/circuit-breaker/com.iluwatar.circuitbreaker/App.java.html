/**
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The intention of the Circuit Builder pattern is to handle remote failures robustly, which is to
 * mean that if a service is dependant on n number of other services, and m of them fail, we should
 * be able to recover from that failure by ensuring that the user can still use the services that
 * are actually functional, and resources are not tied up by uselessly by the services which are not
 * working. However, we should also be able to detect when any of the m failing services become
 * operational again, so that we can use it
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In this example, the circuit breaker pattern is demonstrated by using three services: {@link
 * DelayedRemoteService}, {@link QuickRemoteService} and {@link MonitoringService}. The monitoring
 * service is responsible for calling three services: a local service, a quick remove service
 * {@link QuickRemoteService} and a delayed remote service {@link DelayedRemoteService} , and by
 * using the circuit breaker construction we ensure that if the call to remote service is going to
 * fail, we are going to save our resources and not make the function call at all, by wrapping our
 * call to the remote services in the {@link DefaultCircuitBreaker} implementation object.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This works as follows: The {@link DefaultCircuitBreaker} object can be in one of three states:
 * &lt;b&gt;Open&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Closed&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Half-Open&lt;/b&gt;, which represents the real world circuits. If
 * the state is closed (initial), we assume everything is alright and perform the function call.
 * However, every time the call fails, we note it and once it crosses a threshold, we set the state
 * to Open, preventing any further calls to the remote server. Then, after a certain retry period
 * (during which we expect thee service to recover), we make another call to the remote server and
 * this state is called the Half-Open state, where it stays till the service is down, and once it
 * recovers, it goes back to the closed state and the cycle continues.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
