/**
 * The functional pattern representing a style of organizing libraries
 * centered around the idea of combining functions.
 * Putting it simply, there is some type T, some functions
 * for constructing &quot;primitive&quot; values of type T,
 * and some &quot;combinators&quot; which can combine values of type T
 * in various ways to build up more complex values of type T.
 * The class {@link Finder} defines a simple function {@link Finder#find(String)}
 * and connected functions
 * {@link Finder#or(Finder)},
 * {@link Finder#not(Finder)},
 * {@link Finder#and(Finder)}
 * Using them the became possible to get more complex functions {@link Finders}
