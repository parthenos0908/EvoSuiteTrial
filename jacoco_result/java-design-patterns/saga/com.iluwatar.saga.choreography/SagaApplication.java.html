/**
 * This pattern is used in distributed services to perform a group of operations atomically. This is
 * an analog of transaction in a database but in terms of microservices architecture this is
 * executed in a distributed environment
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A saga is a sequence of local transactions in a certain context.
 * If one transaction fails for some reason, the saga executes compensating transactions(rollbacks)
 * to undo the impact of the preceding transactions.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In this approach, there are no mediators or orchestrators services.
 * All chapters are handled and moved by services manually.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The major difference with choreography saga is an ability to handle crashed services
 * (otherwise in choreography services very hard to prevent a saga if one of them has been crashed)
