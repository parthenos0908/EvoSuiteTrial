/**
 * In Balking Design Pattern if an object窶冱 method is invoked when it is in an inappropriate state,
 * then the method will return without doing anything. Objects that use this pattern are generally
 * only in a state that is prone to balking temporarily but for an unknown amount of time
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In this example implementation WashingMachine is an object that has two states in which it
 * can be: ENABLED and WASHING. If the machine is ENABLED the state is changed into WASHING that any
 * other thread can't invoke this action on this and then do the job. On the other hand if it have
 * been already washing and any other thread execute wash() it can't do that once again and returns
 * doing nothing.
