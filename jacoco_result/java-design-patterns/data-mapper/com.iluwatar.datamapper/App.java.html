/**
 * The Data Mapper (DM) is a layer of software that separates the in-memory objects from the
 * database. Its responsibility is to transfer data between the two and also to isolate them from
 * each other. With Data Mapper the in-memory objects needn't know even that there's a database
 * present; they need no SQL interface code, and certainly no knowledge of the database schema. (The
 * database schema is always ignorant of the objects that use it.) Since it's a form of Mapper ,
 * Data Mapper itself is even unknown to the domain layer.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The below example demonstrates basic CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
