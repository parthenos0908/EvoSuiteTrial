/**
 * Created by Alexis on 28-Apr-17. With Marker interface idea is to make empty interface and extend
 * it. Basically it is just to identify the special objects from normal objects. Like in case of
 * serialization , objects that need to be serialized must implement serializable interface (it is
 * empty interface) and down the line writeObject() method must be checking if it is a instance of
 * serializable or not.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Marker interface vs annotation Marker interfaces and marker annotations both have their uses,
 * neither of them is obsolete or always better then the other one. If you want to define a type
 * that does not have any new methods associated with it, a marker interface is the way to go. If
 * you want to mark program elements other than classes and interfaces, to allow for the possibility
 * of adding more information to the marker in the future, or to fit the marker into a framework
 * that already makes heavy use of annotation types, then a marker annotation is the correct choice
