/**
 * The Mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This
 * pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the program's
 * running behavior.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Usually a program is made up of a large number of classes. So the logic and computation is
 * distributed among these classes. However, as more classes are developed in a program, especially
 * during maintenance and/or refactoring, the problem of communication between these classes may
 * become more complex. This makes the program harder to read and maintain. Furthermore, it can
 * become difficult to change the program, since any change may affect code in several other
 * classes.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;With the Mediator pattern, communication between objects is encapsulated with a mediator
 * object. Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through
 * the mediator. This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby lowering the
 * coupling.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In this example the mediator encapsulates how a set of objects ({@link PartyMember})
 * interact. Instead of referring to each other directly they use the mediator ({@link Party})
 * interface.
