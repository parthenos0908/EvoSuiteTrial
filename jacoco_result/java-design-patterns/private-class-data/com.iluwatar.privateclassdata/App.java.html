/**
 * The Private Class Data design pattern seeks to reduce exposure of attributes by limiting their
 * visibility. It reduces the number of class attributes by encapsulating them in single data
 * object. It allows the class designer to remove write privilege of attributes that are intended to
 * be set only during construction, even from methods of the target class.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In the example we have normal {@link Stew} class with some ingredients given in constructor.
 * Then we have methods to enumerate the ingredients and to taste the stew. The method for tasting
 * the stew alters the private members of the {@link Stew} class.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The problem is solved with the Private Class Data pattern. We introduce {@link ImmutableStew}
 * class that contains {@link StewData}. The private data members of {@link Stew} are now in {@link
 * StewData} and cannot be altered by {@link ImmutableStew} methods.
